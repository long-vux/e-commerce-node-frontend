- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for designing responsive and modern UIs.
- **Material-UI (MUI)**: A React component library for implementing Google's Material Design.
- **React Router**: For handling navigation between different pages.
- **Axios**: For API requests and data fetching.

## Features
- **Product Listings**: Browse a wide range of products.
- **Product Details**: View detailed information about a product.
- **Shopping Cart**: Add, remove, and update cart items.
- **User Authentication**: Sign up, log in, and manage user profiles.
- **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for mobile and desktop.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production in the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified, and the filenames include hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note:** This is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command removes the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it copies all configuration files and transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc.) directly into your project, giving you full control over them. All other commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts, allowing you to tweak them as needed. At this point, you're on your own.

You don't have to use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and medium-sized deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However, we understand that some developers may need additional customization when they are ready for it.
